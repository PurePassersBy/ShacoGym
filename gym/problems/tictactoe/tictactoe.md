# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Background

Two players take turns playing on a three-by-three board. One player plays "X"s and the other "O"s until one player wins by placing three marks in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If the board fills up with neither player getting three in a row, then the game is a draw. "X" moves first.

## Problem

It is easy to prove that a skilled player can play so as never to lose. In this problem, you are playing against an imperfect player, one whose play is sometimes incorrect and allows you to win. In every round of game, you get $1$ score if you win or draw, $0$ if you lose. Try your best to gain higher scores and take this problem as your first journey in ShacoGym!
